#Programming & Technology

This is a combination of every programming class I have taken, most of which at school. However, it also includes programming from outside of school, such as when I did chunks of classes 2.678 and 2.679 at MIT. Uploaded here is the majority of programming I have done (exept a lot of the AI stuff Rey you need to add all that from the PC and also grab all the code from the old laptop, also upload all the unity stuff to show C#, some of the java stuff, and the things in linux). The majority of my expertise was formed in Python, however I am fairly fluent in C# and C++, along with pieces of Java, Ruby, Swift, and many more. Additionally, I have a lot of expierence in CAD, mostly in Onshape, but I have been transitioning into Fusion360, AutoCAD, and SolidWorks.
